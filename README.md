*** WEEK 7 SERVER SIDE CALCULATOR ***

## Description

The objective of this assignment was to create a calculator program that effectively implements the concept of client/server
request/response communication. The calculation logic as well as all calculation data storage occurred on the server side. Upon 
submit action on the client side (DOM), the client packed user input information and sent the data to the server. Upon reception, 
the server then stores input data, performs logic/calculations to obtain the result, and returns the calculation back to the client in object-form. 
The client receives both the most recent calculation result and the result history of all calculations that have been performed thus far.
The client obtains this information and renders both on the DOM for the user to see. The DOM also displays a "C" button which clears
form inputs when clicked on and a "Clear Calculations History" button which clears all previous calculations shown on DOM and clears
history stored on the server.
